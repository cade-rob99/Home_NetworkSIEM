SIEM deployment on my home network
Objective:
This project demonstrates the deployment of a home-based SIEM to monitor network activity, detect suspicious login attempts, and identify connections from known malicious IPs. The goal is to integrate Splunk Enterprise with a custom Python threat intelligence feed, ingest router syslogs, and correlate events to improve network visibility and security.


Using Splunk search queries, I was able to forward syslogs from my router to a Splunk server running on my computer listening for UDP traffic on port 1514. The above screenshot shows one of many DROP logs generated from my router.



Here, I combined my DROP logs with a REST API from AbuseIPDB to compare a list of over 1000 IP addresses with IP addresses that were logged attempting to send traffic to my router. The results were then formatted into a table indicating if the IP address was listed as a malicious IP address, how many attempts this source IP address attempted to send traffic to my router, and the malicious IP confidence score (generated by AbuseIPDB).


Here, I designed a table to represent the number of devices failing to log in to the network. A timer was set to help filter multiple logs generated by 1 event to make sure that individual log-in attempts were recorded (the router would try to log in with the provided credentials a couple of times automatically, even if the user only made 1 login attempt on their end). 




Note: IP addresses shown are from routine firewall DROP events and are included solely for demonstration of the SIEMâ€™s functionality. No accusations are being made here.
Finally, this table shows what ports are being targeted and what the source IP address is, as well as a counter to keep track of which port a suspicious IP address is targeting the most.

Here is the Python script that uses a REST API from AbuseIPDB to populate a CSV file with a list of reported malicious IP addresses, as well as some additional data related to the IP addresses.
